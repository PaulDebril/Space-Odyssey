# Space Odyssey

**Space Odyssey** is a Virtual Reality (VR) educational game that lets players explore the solar system, visit planets, and learn about space through interactive experiences and stunning visuals. Developed in Unity, it provides a fun and immersive way to discover the mysteries of the cosmos. This project was created during my third year of the Bachelor of Technology (BUT) in Computer Science at IUT de Calais.
